### workshop 1 task notes

- when i started i knew I wanted t play around with the ellipse function in order to cerate a flower shape, i tried a lot of different ideas out but eventually went to look at the forums on p5.js
- there i found a code someone had written that utilised a flower shape that i desired
    - https://editor.p5js.org/katiejliu/sketches/Je9G3c5z9
- i isolated the part of the code that created the flower and then had to work out how to adjust it so that it worked with the variables i had chosen, and also decided that i wanted them all to be the same colour so i picked that and plugged the values in
- i then referred back to the example in order to create a code that allowed a random pattern and assortment of flowers to pop up on the screen
- i struggled to think of something else that could be done using the for loop and my function, so i decided to just replicate the example but changing out the exit condition so that more flowers were drawn
